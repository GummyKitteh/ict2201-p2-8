## How to Run
- Install Python (at least Version 3.6)
- Open command prompt in Administrator
- Navigate command prompt to directory containing requirements.txt and app.py
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required modules
- Run `python app.py` to run portal and keep command prompt running
- Open Internet Edge or Google Chrome and enter the URL `http://localhost:5000/`

## Development Workflow
All development work is done on each team member's individual feature branch. Each team member will be working on their allocated features on their individual feature branch. An additional `Document branch` was created to allow all members to modify the `README.md` on this branch. To merge into `dev branch`, a member has to open a pull request on Github which will be reviewed by either Jia Cheng (Tech Lead) or Wen Jie (Assistant Tech Lead). Only Jia Cheng will be allowed to merge `dev branch` into `master branch`. The main reason for allocating several features to an individual branch is for ease of tracking pertaining to M3 grading. Since it is an extremely small project, creating a huge number of branches may in fact harm the implementation proccess instead.

Each team member were assigned an individual feature branch to work on their allocated features as shown below:

## User Acceptance Test
- Embedded video running through all system test case we created (refined test case), 3 minutes long covering all system test case

## Whitebox Testing
- class demo test case (2 or more interactions with other class like Control, not Entity)
- List test case for this class and where they reside in repo
- Show code coverage stats for each test case and how we generated this stats, manual? IDE? Library?
- Provide instructions on how to run the test suite
- embeded gif/short video less than 1minute of test case run
